# Social Media GitHub Repository - README

## Project Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code for a full-stack social media application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The application is designed to be fully functional, allowing users to create posts, engage in real-time chat, and share content similar to popular social media platforms like Facebook.

- Like, comment, and share functionalities for posts
- Responsive design for seamless user experience across devices

## Technologies Used
The application is built using the following technologies:
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data, posts, and chat messages
- Express.js: Backend framework for building RESTful APIs
- React: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- Socket.IO: Real-time communication library for enabling chat functionality
